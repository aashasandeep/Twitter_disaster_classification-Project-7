# Twitter_disaster_classification-Project-7
Twitter_disaster_classification Project-7

Objectives:
Classification Model Development: Develop a machine learning model that can predict
whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.
Accuracy and Precision: Aim for high accuracy and precision in classification to minimize
false alarms and ensure timely and accurate disaster detection.
Robustness: Create a model that can handle variations in language, including slang,
abbreviations, and cultural nuances, to ensure effectiveness across diverse tweet datasets.
Scalability: Build a scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of tweets in real time to support continuous monitoring efforts.
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Remove special characters, URLs, and HTML tags.
Normalize text by converting it to lowercase.
Tokenization: Split text into words.
Stop-word removal and stemming/lemmatization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze word frequencies and tweet lengths.
Visualize common disaster-related terms using word clouds.

Feature Engineering
Transform text data into numerical representations using methods like:
Bag-of-Words (BoW)
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
Word Embeddings (e.g., GloVe, FastText)

Modeling
Build and evaluate various models such as:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests

Evaluation
Metrics used include:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Requirements
The project requires the following tools and libraries:
Python (3.8+),
pandas,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
nltk,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
wordcloud.
